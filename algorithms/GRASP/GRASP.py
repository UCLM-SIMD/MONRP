    __author__      = "Victor.PerezPiqueras@uclm.es" "Pablo.Bermejo@uclm.es"

    A GRASP search with two phases:
      - create initial set of solutions, based on a ranking of probabilities computed from
          pbi scores (as given by self.dataset.pbis_score)
      - local search, to improve solutions based on their neighbourhood

    Attributes
    ----------
    dataset_name: string
        name of the dataset

    dataset: type algorithms.GRASP.Dataset
        each pbi in Dataset is a candidate to be included in one of the GRASP solutions.
        Dataset provides cost, satisfaction and score of each pbi.

    solutions_per_iteration: integer (default = 10)
        number of GRASPSolutions to be initially created and evolved in local search

    NDS: list of algorithms.GRASP.GraspSolution, empty at start.
        it contains the current set of non dominated solutions

    init_type: string, type of initialization.
        possible values are: stochastically (default), uniform

    local_search_type: string, type of search to perform.
        possible values are: best_first_neighbor (default), best_first_neighbor_random, best_first_neighbor_sorted_score

    Methods
    ---------
    get_name(): returns name of the algorithm.

    run(): the method which starts the search.
     It calls the two phases of GRASP: initiate solutions and evolve them with local search

    init_solutions_stochastically(): stochastically construct a former set of solutions,
     each of them containing a set of chosen candidates (pbis)

    init_solutions_uniform(): uniformly construct a former set of solutions,
     each of them containing a set of chosen candidates (pbis)

    local_search_bitwise_neighborhood(initiated_solutions): evolves each of the constructed solutions in the initiation
    phase, running an incremental best first search over each solution, using mono_objective_score as goodness metric 

    local_search_bitwise_neighborhood_random(initiated_solutions): evolves each of the constructed solutions in the initiation
    phase, running an incremental best first search over each solution, using mono_objective_score as goodness metric and randomness

    best_first_neighbor_sorted_score(initiated_solutions): evolves each of the constructed solutions in the initiation
    phase, running an incremental best first search over each solution, using mono_objective_score as goodness metric and sorting
    candidates of each solution by score.

    update_nds(solutions): at the end of each GRASP iteration, the global self.NDS list of solutions is updated based on the
        constructed and evolved solutions in such iteration.
